# This GitHub acts as a repository for Andy Cross
#### Code in this repository is primairly developed in to aid in processing results from hydrologic models. All of the R scripts are developed to process and large data, while the ArcPY scripts are developed to calculate hydrologic parameters for surface water modeling. Inputs are hard coded, and as such must be modified before scripts are run.
